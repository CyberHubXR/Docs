# Overview

The Foundry Core Package provides the runtime networking and database SDK, as well as common utilities for setup and configuration of Foundry Packages. 

## Configuration

All Foundry packages require a Foundry App Key to be set in the configuration. Until we build a public we frontend join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/FJUNGXvNf8) and ask to get into our Beta, chances are we'll get you a Foundry App Key as soon as we see the message.

To set the Foundry App Key, navigate to `Foundry -> Config Manager` and set the `App Key` field under the Foundry Core section to the key you received.
