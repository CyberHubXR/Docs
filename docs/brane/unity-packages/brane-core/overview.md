# Overview

The Brane Core Package provides common utilities for setup and configuration of Brane Packages. 

## Configuration

All Brane Backend packages require a Brane App Key to be set in the Brane Core package. Until we build a public we frontend join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/FJUNGXvNf8) and ask to get into our Beta, chances are we'll get you a Brane App Key as soon as we see the message.

To set the Brane App Key, navigate to `Brane -> Config Manager` and set the `App Key` field under the Brane Core section to the key you received.
