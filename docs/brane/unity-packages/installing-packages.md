# Installing Packages

To get access to any of the CyberHub packages, you just need to add the scoped registry to your project.

## Adding the Scoped Registry

Navigate to  `Edit -> Project Settings -> Package Manager`

make sure to toggle on the `Show preview packages` option to make sure you're not missing out on any of the latest features.

Then scroll down to the `Scoped Registries` section and add the following scoped registry:

```
name   CyberHub
url    http://unity.cyberhubxr.com
scopes com.cyberhub
```
