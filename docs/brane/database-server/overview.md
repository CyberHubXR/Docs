# Overview

The Brane Database Server is a backend service that provides a simple interface for storing and retrieving data primarily for users. We primarily provide hosting managed by us, so you can mostly ignore this section, but if you want to write something that interacts with the server api directly, or we've given you a self-hosted executable, this is the place to go.
